## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

question 1

sum (seq ( 100, 1000, 100))

question 2 

sum (1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)

question 3

for(a in 1:10)
  print (a-3)

question 4

custom_funnction <- function(X1,xn,step){
  the_sum <- (((xn-x1)/step)+1) * ((x1+xn)/2)
  return(the_sum)
}   

custom_funnction( x1=10, xn=100, step=10)

sum (seq(10,100,10))



question 5

```
seq(10,100,10)
sum(seq(10,100,10))

sum_seq <- function(start,end,step){
  sequence <- seq(start,end,step)
  the_sum <- sum(sequence)
  
  my_output <- list (the_sequence=sequence
                      sum=the_sum)
    return(my_output)


sum_seq (10,100,10)
```

question 6
