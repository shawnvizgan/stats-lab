## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


A. Compute Pearsonâ€™s r and report the associated p-value using the cor.test() function. (2 points)

B. Use a permutation test to create a null-distribution, and report the p-value for getting the observed correlation or larger using your simulated null-distribution. (2 points)

Using the variables X and Y above, and assuming that the values could be re-ordered in any way, report the following:

A. the smallest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)

B. the largest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)


Correlation part
```{r}


X <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)
Y <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)

cor.test(X,Y)










```





permutation part

p = .0659 to get the correlation above when replicated 10,001 times
```{r}
rand_1000 <- replicate(10001,cor(rnorm(X),rnorm(Y)))
hist(rand_1000)


mean(rand_1000)

max(rand_1000)

min(rand_1000)

length(rand_1000[rand_1000 > .51])/10000 


```

min and max sum of cross products

rather than having to simulate it a bunch times, I just used to sort function to minimize and maximize how these values might corerlate

```{r}

max_scp <-sum(sort(x)*sort(y))

min_scp <- sum(sort(x)*-sort(y))


print(max_scp)
print(min_scp)

```
