1.Trust but verify. We trust that the rnorm() will generate random deviates in accordance with the definition of the normal distribution. For example, we learned in this lab, that a normal distribution with mean = 0, and sd =1 , should only produce values larger than 2.5 with a specific small probability, that is P(x>2.5) = 0.006209665. Verify this is approximately the case by randomly sampling 1 million numbers from this distribution, and calculate what proportion of numbers are larger than 2.5.
```{r}
rnorm(n=1000000, mean = 0, sd = 1)

library(ggplot2)
observations <- rnorm(n=1000000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
                        






print(length(observations[observations > 2.5])/1000000
      )


#the proportion of numbers in a sample of 1 million that are larger than 2.5 is even smaller in this case.













```
2)
```{r}

pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 10, log = TRUE)

#there are 10000 people

abs(pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 10, log = TRUE) * 10000)
```




3 You randomly sample 25 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 10 and standard deviation = 20. You obtain a sample mean of 12. You want to know the probability that you could have received a sample mean of 12 or larger.
```{r}



some_observations3 <- replicate(10000 , mean(rnorm(25,10,20)))
  (length(some_observations3 [some_observations3 > 12])/10000)






```




question 4)
```{r}


some_observations4 <- replicate(10000 , mean(rnorm(100,10,20)))
  (length(some_observations4 [some_observations4 > 12])/10000)


#as the amount of numbers in a distribution increase, it limits the size of values that are larger than the mean. 100 is the square of 10, and 25 is the suare of 5, so 4 times the number of samples means ends up causing there to be half the probability of having a value 12 or more.
```



question 5) You randomly sample 25 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 10 and standard deviation = 20. You obtain a sample standard deviation of 15. You want to know the probability that you could have received a sample standard deviation of 15 or less.

```{r}
 some_observations5 <- replicate(10000 , sd(rnorm(25,10,20)))
  length(some_observations5 [some_observations5 <= 15])/10000
```
