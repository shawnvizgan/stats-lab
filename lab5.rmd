1.Trust but verify. We trust that the rnorm() will generate random deviates in accordance with the definition of the normal distribution. For example, we learned in this lab, that a normal distribution with mean = 0, and sd =1 , should only produce values larger than 2.5 with a specific small probability, that is P(x>2.5) = 0.006209665. Verify this is approximately the case by randomly sampling 1 million numbers from this distribution, and calculate what proportion of numbers are larger than 2.5.
```{r}
rnorm(n=1000000, mean = 0, sd = 1)

library(ggplot2)
some_data <- data.frame(observations = rnorm(n=10000, mean = 0, sd = 1),
                        type = "A")

ggplot(some_data, aes(x=observations)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=100, color="black",
                 fill= 'red')


print(some_data$observations[some_data$observations > 2.5])

length(some_data$observations[some_data$observations > 2.5])/1000000


print(length(some_data$observations[some_data$observations > 2.5])/1000000)


#the proportion of numbers in a sample of 1 million that are larger than 2.5 is even smaller in this case.













```
2)
```{r}

pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 10, log = TRUE)

#there are 10000 people

abs(pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 10, log = TRUE) * 10000)
```




3 You randomly sample 25 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 10 and standard deviation = 20. You obtain a sample mean of 12. You want to know the probability that you could have received a sample mean of 12 or larger.
```{r}


print(pnorm(12, mean=10, sd = 20, lower.tail=FALSE))







```




question 4)
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
some_data <- data.frame(observations = rnorm(n=10000, mean = 10, sd = 20),
                        type = "A")

(length(some_data$observations[some_data$observations > 12])/10000)
```
