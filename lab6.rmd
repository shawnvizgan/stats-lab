## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

 library(ggplot2)

 mean(group_1)-mean(group_2)


 all_scores <- c(group_1,group_2)
 resample <- sample(all_scores)
 new_1_mean <- mean(resample[1:50])
 new_2_mean <- mean(resample[51:100])
 new_difference <- new_1_mean-new_2_mean

   resample <- sample(all_scores)
   new_1_mean <- mean(resample[1:50])
   new_2_mean <- mean(resample[51:100])
   mean_differences[i] <- new_1_mean-new_2_mean
 }

   geom_histogram(color="blue")+
   geom_vline(xintercept=mean(group_1) - mean(group_2), color ="purple")+
   theme_classic()


 length(mean_differences[mean_differences >= 4]) / length(mean_differences)

```
