## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

all_data <- fread("open_data/When not choosing leads to not liking_Data.csv")

e1_data <- all_data %>%
  filter(ExperimentNumber == "1")
# conduct binomial test


sum_C <- sum(e1_data$Infant.Chose.C)
total_C <- length(e1_data$Infant.Chose.C)
(binomial_p <- pbinom(q = total_C - sum_C,
                      size = total_C, 
                      prob = .5, 
                      lower.tail = TRUE)*2)
# chi-square for gender



library(tidyr)

gender_choice_table <- e1_data %>%
  group_by(Gender, "Infant Chose C") %>%
  summarize(counts = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(Gender),
              values_from = counts)



gender_choice_table <- gender_choice_table[,2:3]
(gender_Xsq <- chisq.test(gender_choice_table))  
uncorrected_Xsq <- sum((gender_Xsq$observed-gender_Xsq$expected)^2/gender_Xsq$expected)
gender_Xsq_unc <- pchisq(uncorrected_Xsq,1,lower.tail = FALSE)
# chi-square for age

age_table <- e1_data %>%
  group_by(AgeMonths, "Infant Chose C") %>%
  summarize(counts = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(AgeMonths),
              values_from = counts)



age_table[is.na(age_table)] <- 0
age_table <- as.matrix(age_table[,2:21])
(age_xs <- chisq.test(age_table))

the researchers claimed that for their results

results for 1a: according to a two-tailed binomial test, p = .026, 95% exact confidence interval (CI) = [52.83%, 91.78%], relative risk ratio = 1.52. A chi-square test of independence indicated no significant effect of age or gender on infants’ choices, χ2(19, N = 21) = 18.24, p = .506, and χ2(1, N = 21) = 0.15, p = .696




results for 1b were: according to a two-tailed binomial test, p = .029, 95% exact CI = [52.21%, 88.43%], relative risk ratio = 1.46. A chi-square test of independence indicated no significant effect of age or gender on infants’ choices, χ2(20, N = 26) = 20.92, p = .402, and χ2(1, N = 26) = 0.20, p = .658, respectively.

Another issue is that For 21 infants, there is somehow 19 degrees of freedom, which is a mathemetical impossibility. The reason it says 19 is because when you look at the ages of infants, two children were identical in age, as a result they would lumped in together as one category (age is a continuous variable also) hence the results of the test have been skewed

we see that they messed up first in using a chi square table, as the cbi square table can not give any new answers, since no matter what happens the babies can make only one of two choices, which is in line with reality. A different sort of statistical test or measure is needed, maybe a binomial test, to actually test whether the results were significant


As shown below, there is actually a super low probability (2-3%) that it could be within a normal likelihood for 16 infants out of 21 to choose one shape over the other (as simple as this test is). There may be some sort of unique interaction when 16 children chose one toy over the other, just the chi square is not how you calculate it.


```{r}

binom.test(x = 16,
           n = 21,
           p = .5,
        )
