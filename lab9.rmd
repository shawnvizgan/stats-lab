## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(dplyr)
e1_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(ExperimentNumber == "1")
# conduct binomial test
sum_C <- sum(e1_data$Infant.Chose.C)
total_C <- length(e1_data$Infant.Chose.C)
(binomial_p <- pbinom(q = total_C - sum_C,
                      size = total_C, 
                      prob = .5, 
                      lower.tail = TRUE)*2)
# chi-square for gender
library(tidyr)
gender_choice_table <- e1_data %>%
  group_by(Gender, Infant.Chose.C) %>%
  summarize(counts = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(Gender),
              values_from = counts)
gender_choice_table <- gender_choice_table[,2:3]
(gender_Xsq <- chisq.test(gender_choice_table))  
uncorrected_Xsq <- sum((gender_Xsq$observed-gender_Xsq$expected)^2/gender_Xsq$expected)
gender_Xsq_unc <- pchisq(uncorrected_Xsq,1,lower.tail = FALSE)
# chi-square for age
age_table <- e1_data %>%
  group_by(AgeMonths, Infant.Chose.C) %>%
  summarize(counts = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = c(AgeMonths),
              values_from = counts)
age_table[is.na(age_table)] <- 0
age_table <- as.matrix(age_table[,2:21])
(age_xs <- chisq.test(age_table))
