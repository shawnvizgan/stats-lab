## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
1)Write a function to convert a vector of raw-scores into z-scores. The function should have inputs for the vector, the mean and sd of the normal distribution, and should return a vector of zscores. (1 point). Also, demonstrate that the function works correctly (1 point). How you make the demonstration is up to you.
Advanced: Have an option so that the function will convert the raw scores to zscores in one of two ways:
using user provided mean and standard deviation
using the calculated mean and standard deviation from the raw scores
```{r}
sample_means <- replicate(10000, mean(rnorm(10,25,5)))

specialsample <- sample((sample_means), 10 , replace = FALSE)

standard_error <- 5/(sqrt(10))

u <- 25
  
z_test <- function(mean(specialsample)- u)/standard_error)

```

Base R does not have a function for a z-test. Write a function to accomplish a one-sample z-test. Remember, a one-sample z test is used to compare the probability of obtaining the sample mean (or larger or smaller) if it came from a known normal distribution. (2 points).
Use your z-test function to conduct a test of the following. A sample of 25 scores is taken. The mean of the sample is 50. The sample is assumed to have been taken from a normal distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation 7. Report a one-tailed z-test, examining the probability of obtaining a sample of greater than 50 in this situation. Report the results, and give a brief sentence explaining the result and the inference you make (2 points).
