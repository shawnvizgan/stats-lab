## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




Y= c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10),
X= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)

Should you do a linear regression on this data? Explain.

To put it most simply, why in the hell would you do a check for linear regression for data that is not a line? Doing the regression for fun/masochism/wasting my own time, you can see that a correlation of 0 get's picked up. Assumption of a straight line and checking for differences from a straight line and that variation simply will not work. However, it is funny to look at 

```{r}


some_data <- data.frame(Y_dv= c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10),
                        X_iv= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19))

lm(Y_dv ~ X_iv, data=some_data)


save_model <- lm(Y_dv ~ X_iv, data=some_data)
summary(save_model)$r.squared

cor.test(some_data$Y_dv,some_data$X_iv)

summary(save_model)$r.squared

sqrt(summary(save_model)$r.squared)


library(ggplot2)

ggplot(some_data, aes(x=X_iv, y=Y_dv))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)
```
