## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


1) Create five samples of 25 observations from a normal distribution with mean 200, and )standard deviation 100. Compute the mean of each sample, and plot the means in a graph using ggplot2. (1 point)
```{R}
library(dplyr)  
a <- rnorm(25*5, 200, 100)

my_data <- data.frame(observations = rnorm(25*5, 200, 100),
                      the_samples = rep(1:5, each=25))

my_means <- my_data %>%
  group_by(the_samples) %>%
  summarise(the_means = mean(observations))

library(ggplot2)
 
ggplot(my_means, aes(x = the_samples, y = the_means))+
  geom_point()

my_matrix <- matrix(0, ncol =25, nrow = 5)

for(i in 1:5){
  rnorm(25, mean = 200, sd = 100)
}



```
2) Additionally calculate the standard deviation of each sample from above. Use the standard deviations for error bars, and produce another graph with the means along with error bars using ggplot2. (1 point)
```{r}
 
summarise(standard_deviation = std(observations))

library(ggplot2)
 
ggplot(my_means, aes(x = the_samples, y = standard_deviation))+
  geom_point()

my_matrix <- matrix(0, ncol =25, nrow = 5)

for(i in 1:5){
  rnorm(25, mean = 200, sd = 100)
}
