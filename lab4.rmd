## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

question 1)
```{r}
rolls <-  sample(1:6,10000, replace=TRUE)       

table(rolls)

```

question 2
```{r}

one <- sample(1:6,10000, replace=TRUE) 
two <- sample(1:6,10000, replace=TRUE) 
combined <- one+two
table(combined)/1000
```
question 3)
```{r}

step <- c(0)

for(i in 1:10000){
  coin_flip <- sample(c(1, -1), 1)
  step[i+1] <- step[i]+coin_flip
}

plot(step[1:10000])









```
question 4)
```{r}

max(step[1:10000])


```
question 5) 
```{r}

logical_step <- sign(step)


sequence <- c()
counter <- 0
for(i in 1:length(logical_step)){
  sequence <- c(sequence,counter)
  counter <- 0
} else {
  counter <- counter+logical_step[i]
}


max(sequence)
min(sequence)


```
